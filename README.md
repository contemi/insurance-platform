## Business Case
Modern insurers are adopting Open Source into their IT architecture at an increasing pace. What is not yet available is an insurance platform for a new insurer to get “off the shelf”, can adopt, configure and run their business. Nor, is there an insurance platform that a well-established insurer can pick up and run and manage new lines of business in short time scale.

Contemi intends to help create such an insurance platform that can be developed in such a way to allow insurers (new and old) to do the things an insurer just has to do, but with sufficient flexibility to do it in their way, to encompass new trends and to stay competitive.

Contemi is going to leverage its own modern, core policy management system as the start point for the platform. Whilst the system needs to be re-shaped for the Open Source community – it is a system already being used by insurers. Previous versions of the system are being used by companies today to transact their business. Contemi has many years of experience developing insurance applications and systems for big and small insurers.
